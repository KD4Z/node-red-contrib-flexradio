           4.8.2 describes shares like:
           $share/{ShareName}/{filter}
           $share is a literal string that marks the Topic Filter as being a Shared Subscription Topic Filter.
           {ShareName} is a character string that does not include "/", "+" or "#"
           {filter} The remainder of the string has the same syntax and semantics as a Topic Filter in a non-shared subscription. Refer to section 4.7.
