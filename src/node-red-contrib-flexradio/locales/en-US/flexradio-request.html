<script type="text/html" data-help-name="flexradio-request">
	<p>Connects to a FlexRadio 6xxx series radio and sends requests (commands), receives responses, and publishes the responses to the flow.</p>

    <h3>Node Configuration</h3>
    <h4>FlexRadio</h4>
    <p>This is the radio configuration to connect to. You can select an existing connection or create a new one. To conserve resources on the radio, you should have only one (shared) connection per radio across all your flows on a system.</p>

    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
       <dt>payload <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
       <dd> the request (command) to send. If this property is not set, no message will be sent. To send a blank message, set this property to an empty String. See Input Details below for more information about requests and commands.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload <span class="property-type">string | Object</span></dt>
            <dd> a string or Object containing the response from the input command. The format of the payload varies based on the reuqest, see Output Details below.</dd>
        <dt>sequence_number <span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
            <dd> the sequence number that was assigned to the input command.</dd>
        <dt>status_code <span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
            <dd> a number indicating success (0) or failure (non-zero).</dd>
     </dl>
    
    <h3>Input Details</h3>
    <code>msg.payload</code> is used as the request (command) sent to the radio. A comprehensive list of valid commands can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.flexradio.com">FlexRadio Wiki</a> under <a href="http://wiki.flexradio.com/index.php?title=SmartSDR_TCP/IP_API#SmartSDR_TCP.2FIP_Commands">SmartSDR TCP/IP Commands</a>. Note that in the wiki commands are shown with command sequence prefixes, e.x. <code>C1|info</code>. The prefix should not be specified as part of the <code>msg.payload</code> for this node. The prefix and command sequence is generated by the node internally. Only the command should be sent in <code>msg.payload</code>, e.x. <code>info</code>.

    <h3>Output Details</h3>
    Many radio requests (commands) generate only success or failure as a result of their execution. In these cases <code>msg.payload</code> is a copy of the input request (command). In the case where the request (command) generates output <code>msg.payload</code> will be an Object with that output. For example a successful <code>ant list</code> request will result in an Array <code>[ "ANT1", "ANT2", ...]</code> being output in <code>msg.payload</code>.
    
    <h3>Node Details</h3>
    <p>This node requires a connection to a radio using <code>flexradio-radio</code>to be configured. This is configured by clicking the pencil icon. As indicated above, all <code>flexradio-</code> nodes that work with the same radio can and should share the same connection to conserve radio resources.</p>
