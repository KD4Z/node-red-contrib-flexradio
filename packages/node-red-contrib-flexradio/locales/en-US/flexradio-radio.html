	<p>Configuration for a connection to a FlexRadio 6xxx series radio.</p>

	<p>This configuration will create a single connection to a radio which can then be shared and used by <code>flexradio-messages</code>, <code>flexradio-request</code>, and <code>flexradio-meter</code> nodes. To preserve radio resources, you should only have one connection node per radio in your flows. This connection can then be shared by any number of <code>flexradio-</code> nodes.</p>

    <h3>Node Configuration</h3>
    <h4>Radio</h4>
    <p>The radio to connect to can be configured in different ways depending on your setup.</p>

    <dl>
    <dt>Automatic</dt>
        <dd>Watches for radio announcements on your network and connects to the first Flexradio found. The most common choice <strong>if you have only one radio</strong>.</dd>

    <dt>Discovery</dt>
        <dd>Watches for radio announcements on your network and provides a list of radios to choose from. Connects to the radio based on it's nickname. This is the most common connection choice if you have multiple radios.</dd>

    <dt>Dynamic</dt>
        <dd>Uses <code>msg.action</code> property from request nodes to connect or disconnect from a radio. <code>msg.action</code> can be:
        <ul>
            <li><code>connect</code> will attempt to connect to the radio as specified in the <code>msg.radio</code> property.</li>
            <li><code>disconnect</code> will terminate an active connection to the radio. If the radio is configured for anything other than Dynamic the connection will be retried after a short timeout period. 
            </li>
        </ul>
  
        When <code>msg.action</code> is set to <code>connect</code>, the <code>msg.radio</code> property specifies the parameters to use in connecting to a radio. The <code>host_mode</code> property of <code>msg.radio</code> specifies how to connect and what additional fields are required.

        <ul>
            <li><code>automatic</code> requires no additional properties, radio use Automatic configuration.</li>
            <li><code>nickname</code> requires an additional <code>nickname</code> property, radio will use Discovery connection to the given nickname.</li>
            <li><code>manual</code> requires additional <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> properties, the radio will use Manual connection to the host and port.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>Manual</dt>
        <dd>Allows you to specify the <strong>Host</strong>> (IP address or DNS name) and <strong>Port</strong> of a radio. Useful if you have fixed addresses and/or names for devices on your network.</dd>

    </dl>

	<!--
	<h4>Timeout</h4>
    <p>This is the time in seconds that the node will try to reconnect to the radio when the connection is lost or disconnected because of an error. The default is <code>15</code> seconds.</p>
    <h4>Station</h4>
    <p>Reserved for future use.</p>
	-->

    <h3>Node Details</h3>
    <p>This configuration node manages the network connection (both TCP and UDP) to the radio. Once it connects to a radio, it self-configures based on the radio it is attached to. It will trigger a few requests (commands) of its own, like <code>meter list</code>, so that other nodes can re-use common information without constant queries to the radio.</p>
