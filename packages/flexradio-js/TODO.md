# TODO

* Update meter list when new meters are added (or when external runs `meter list`?)

* Add ping/pong to keep connection alive. Currently it times out after a minute or two if idle.

* Add "raw" to get raw data from messages and responses

* Clean up readme to be public face. Remove developer notes.
