	<p>Configuration for a connection to a FlexRadio 6xxx series radio.</p>

	<p>This configuration will create a single connection to a radio which can then be shared and used by <code>flexradio-messages</code>, <code>flexradio-request</code>, and <code>flexradio-meter</code> nodes. To preserve radio resources, you should only have one connection node per radio in your flows. This connection can then be shared by any number of <code>flexradio-</code> nodes.</p>

    <h4>Host</h4>
    <p>This is the address of the radio to connect to. You can specify either a DNS name or an IP address.</p>

	<h4>Port</h4>
    <p>This is the TCP/IP port the radio is listening on. This should not change from the default <code>4992</code> except for advanced uses.</p>

	<!--
    <h4>Station</h4>
    <p>Reserved for future use.</p>
